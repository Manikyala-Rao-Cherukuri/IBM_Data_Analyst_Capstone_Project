# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project:
In this project, I have used the data collected as part of 2019 stack overflow developers survey [https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/].

### Data Analysis will have the insights regarding the following:
- Current Technology Usage (i.e., Popular Languages, Databases, Platforms & Web Frames)
- Future Technology Usage (I.e., Desired languages, Databases, Platforms, Web Frames)
- Demographics (I.e., Gender, Age & Education levels between the Developers along with developers count per country)

These findings, will help us to understand what are the popular & desired technologies which are mostly liked by the software developers.
